a machine learning python project to predict sales
The dataset would scale with the number of customers on that day. Thus by plotting the trend, it is able to confirm that there was a correlation between customers and sales. Continuing with this insight, it is able to separate them by the day of week, confirming that some days were correlating more strongly than others. 

 the use of regression approaches can often give us better results compared to time series methods. Machine-learning algorithms make it possible to find patterns in the time series. We can find complicated patterns in the sales dynamics, using supervised machine-learning methods. Some of the most popular are tree-based machine-learning algorithms. We have implemented normal regression techniques and as well as boosting techniques in our approach and have found that the boosting algorithms have better results than the regular regression algorithms. By continuing using the ensemble methods such as Adaboost and Random Forest, which gave an improvement on the validation set.

Adaboost gave better score and variance sometimes versus Random Trees. But the XGBoost gave great results with the existing data set. Interestingly, the features that XGBoost chose did not have the same ranking as other models.
